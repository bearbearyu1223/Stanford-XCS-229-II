\textbf{Error Analysis.}
You train a system, and its errors are as follows (Error = 100\% - Accuracy): 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Training Error: 4.0\%
    \item Dev Error: 4.5\%
\end{enumerate}

Team member one suggests training a bigger network so as to drive down the 4.0\% Team member two claims you shouldn’t increase the network’s size because it is overfitting. Who do you agree with? Select one option below.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Team member one because the 4.0\% training error indicates high bias.
    \item Team member one because training a larger model will allow for better training and generalization error.
    \item Team member two because the dev error is significantly higher than the training error.
    \item There’s not enough information to tell.
\end{enumerate}
