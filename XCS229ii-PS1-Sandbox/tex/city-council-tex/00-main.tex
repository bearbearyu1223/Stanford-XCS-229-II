\item {\bf City Council: Vehicle Detection Model}

This example is adapted from a real production application, but with details disguised to protect confidentiality.\\

The City Council wants to deploy a model that will detect whether or not there’s a motorized vehicle in a given street. Your goal is to build an algorithm that will detect whether or not a motorized vehicle is in an image taken by a street’s security camera. The City Council gives you a dataset of 1,000,000 labelled images taken by the streets security cameras. They are labelled:	
\begin{itemize}
    \item y=0: There is no motorized vehicle in the image
    \item y=1: There is a motorized vehicle in the image	
\end{itemize}

There are a lot of decisions to make which includes but is not limited to defining the evaluation metric, deciding how to structure the data into train/val/test sets, etc. The goal of this problem is to give you the opportunity to apply concepts from machine learning theory to make important decisions on how to create an effective car detection model.
