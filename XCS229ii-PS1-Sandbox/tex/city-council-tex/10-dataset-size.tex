\textbf{Dataset Size.}
Suppose instead of giving you 1,000,000 images the city gave you 10,000,000 images, resulting in proportionally larger training, test, and dev sets. Which of the following statements do you agree with? Select all that apply.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item The increase in training set size will decrease the speed within which your team can iterate.
    \item Buying faster computers could speed up your teamâ€™s iteration speed and thus increase productivity.
    \item Training and validating on a larger set of accurate data will likely result in a better model.
    \item It may make sense to only use a subset of $k$ samples from the data in the case that the marginal performance benefit of using additional samples is small compared to the slow-down in iteration speed.
\end{enumerate}
