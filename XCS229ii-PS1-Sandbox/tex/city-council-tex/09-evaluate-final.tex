\textbf{Final Evaluation.}
You also evaluate your model on the test set, and find the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Human-level performance: 0.1\%
    \item Training-set performance: 0.05\%
    \item Dev-set error: 0.05\%
\end{enumerate}

What can you conclude? Select all that apply.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item This is a statistical anomaly (or must be the result of statistical noise) since it should not be possible to surpass human-level performance.
    \item Itâ€™s now harder to gauge avoidable bias, thus progress will be slower moving forward.
    \item With only 0.05\% further progress to make, you should be able to close the gap to 0.00\%
    \item If the dev set is big enough for the 0.05\% error estimate to be accurate, then we know that the Bayes error $<=$ 0.05\% 
\end{enumerate}
