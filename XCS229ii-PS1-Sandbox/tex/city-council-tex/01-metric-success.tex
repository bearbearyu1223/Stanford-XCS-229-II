\textbf{Metric of Success.}
The City Council tells you that they want an algorithm that

\begin{itemize}
    \item Has high accuracy
    \item Runs quickly and takes only a short time to classify a new image 
    \item Can fit in a small amount of memory, so that it can run in a small processor that the city will attach to security cameras
\end{itemize}

What are the pros and cons of having three different evaluation metrics? Select all that apply:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Comparing two different algorithms becomes ambiguous. Itâ€™s not inherently clear when one is better than another.
    \item Having to optimize three different things will likely result in more iterations for your team.
    \item In this case, having multiple evaluation metrics allows us to make sure we come up with a practical, useful algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
