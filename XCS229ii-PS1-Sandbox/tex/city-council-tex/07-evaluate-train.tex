\textbf{Evaluate and Improve from Training-Dev Set.}
Suppose you see the following human-level performance and training/dev performance
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Human-level performance: 0.1\%
    \item Training-set error: 2.0\%
    \item Dev-set error: 1.9\%
\end{enumerate}

Based on the evidence you have, which two of the following five options seem the most promising to try? Select two options.	

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Train a more complex model to try to do better on the training set.
    \item Train a less complex model on the training set to try and avoid overfitting.
    \item Get a bigger training set to reduce variance.
    \item Try increasing regularization.
    \item Try decreasing regularization.
\end{enumerate}
