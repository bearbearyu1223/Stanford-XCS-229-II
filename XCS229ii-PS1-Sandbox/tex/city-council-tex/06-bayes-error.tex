\textbf{Bayes Error.}
Bayes error is the lowest possible error rate for any classifier of a random outcome (into, for example, one of two categories) and is analogous to the irreducible error (you can not reduce it anymore). Human-level performance is the best outcome for any human being. Which of the following statements do you agree with?	Select one option below.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item  A learning algorithm’s performance can be better than human-level performance but it can never be better than Bayes error.
    \item  A learning algorithm’s performance can never be better than human-level performance but it can be better than Bayes error.	
    \item A learning algorithm’s performance can never be better than human-level performance nor better than Bayes error.
    \item A learning algorithm’s performance can be better than human-level performance and better than Bayes error. 
\end{enumerate}
