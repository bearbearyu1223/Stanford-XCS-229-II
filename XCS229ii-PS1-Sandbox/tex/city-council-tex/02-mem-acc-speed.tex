\textbf{Memory vs Accuracy vs Speed.}
Suppose the predictions are not going to be used in real time. Which ordering, from most to least important, best encapsulates the relative importance of accuracy, speed, and memory?

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Accuracy, Speed, Memory 
    \item Speed, Accuracy, Memory 
    \item Memory, Accuracy, Speed
    \item Speed, Memory, Accuracy
\end{enumerate}
