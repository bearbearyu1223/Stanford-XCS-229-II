\textbf{Evaluate and Improve from Test Set.}
You also evaluate your model on the test set, and find the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Human-level performance: 0.1\%
    \item Training-set performance: 2.0\%
    \item Dev-set error: 2.1\%
    \item Test-set error: 7.0\%
\end{enumerate}

What does this mean? Select the two best options.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item You overfit the dev set.
    \item You should try to get a bigger dev set to try and avoid overfitting.
    \item You have underfit the dev set.
    \item You should get a bigger test set 
\end{enumerate}
