\textbf{$\mathcal{F}$ Decrease.}
Decreasing the size of $\mathcal{F}$ will likely  (select all that apply):

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Decrease the out of sample mean squared error because $\hat{f}$ will better estimate $f$, thereby decreasing the squared bias
    \item Increase the out of sample mean squared error because $\hat{f}$ will worse estimate $f$, thereby increasing the squared bias
    \item Decrease the out of sample mean squared error because $\hat{f}$ will be less variable, thereby decreasing the variance
    \item Increase the out of sample mean squared error because $\hat{f}$ will be more variable, thereby increasing the variance
\end{enumerate}
