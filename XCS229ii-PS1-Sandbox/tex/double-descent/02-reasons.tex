\textbf{Explaining Double Descent.}
Which of the following reasons explain why we see double descent? Select all that apply.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item The weights which allow an under-parameterized model to (over)fit the training data are unlikely to generalize to unseen data.
    \item Under-parameterized models are unable to fit the training data, hence they perform worse than over parameterized models.
    \item When models are overparameterized the randomness of SGD sometimes ends up training models which generalize well.
    \item In the over-parameterized regime the implicit bias of SGD results in finding solutions that generalize well to unseen data.
\end{enumerate}
