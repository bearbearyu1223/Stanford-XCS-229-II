\textbf{Training Data.}
Which of the following is the most likely reason for the regime where having more training data hurt the performance of the model? Select one option below.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item The additional data may not have the same distribution as the original data, making it harder for the model to find patterns in the data.
    \item It takes longer to train on more data, meaning there likely weren’t as many iterations for tuning the hyperparameters.
    \item The size and location of the double descent peaks are unpredictable and not yet understood. This is one possible way they can manifest in the training/testing process.
    \item Since the critical regime for training on more data is shifted to the right, the double descent peaks don’t line up. This results in the behavior we see.
\end{enumerate}
