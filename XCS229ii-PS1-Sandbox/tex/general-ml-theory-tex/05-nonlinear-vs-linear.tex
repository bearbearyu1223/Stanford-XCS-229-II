\textbf{Non-linear vs Linear.}
In the following four situations state whether you would rather use a non-linear class of models or linear class of models while training.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The sample size $n$ is very large and the number of predictors $p$ is very small.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item Linear
      \item Non-linear
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The number of predictors $p$ is very large and the sample size $n$ is very small.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item Linear
      \item Non-linear
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The relationship between the predictors and the response is highly polynomial.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item Linear
      \item Non-linear
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The variance of the errors is very high.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item Linear
      \item Non-linear
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
