\textbf{Neural Networks.}
Suppose you initialize all the weights in your neural network to 0. What will happen during training? Select one option below.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item The gradients will all be 0 so the weights will remain 0 throughout training.
    \item The neural net will never break symmetry (the weights across a particular hidden layer will remain identical) throughout training.
    \item The neural net will train normally and learn to fit the data.
\end{enumerate}
