\textbf{Test vs Dev.}
You’re tuning hyperparameters for a model using cross-validation. After selecting your hyper parameters you try out the model on a test set. The test set performance is much worse than the dev performance. Which of the following may be the case? Select all that apply.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item You overfit the dev set.
    \item The test set distribution does not mirror the dev set distribution.
    \item You don’t have enough dev data, so the dev error estimate is noisy.
    \item You’re using too much regularization.
\end{enumerate}
