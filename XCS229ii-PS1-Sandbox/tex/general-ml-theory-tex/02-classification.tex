\textbf{Classification Model.}
You are asked to build a classification model that predicts whether or not there will be an earthquake in California on a given day (a rare event). You build a model which achieves 98\% accuracy on daily, incoming data for the next few months. Should you be confident that the model has learned something?

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Yes
    \item No
